                        <p style="font-size: 20px"> The sixth generation Ford Mustang (S550) is the current iteration of
                            the Mustang pony car manufactured by Ford. In departure from prior Mustang models, the sixth
                            generation Mustang includes fully independent rear suspension on all models, as well as an
                            optional 2.3L EcoBoost turbocharged and direct injected four cylinder engine. The new
                            Mustang was introduced as a 2015 model year vehicle, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the
                            Ford Mustang, which was revealed as a 1965 model year vehicle on April 17, 1964.The sixth
                            generation is also the first Ford Mustang to be marketed and sold globally, and represented
                            the first time that factory right hand drive Mustangs were produced in addition to the left
                            hand drive models. This is part of the "One Ford" business plan, which also applies to the
                            Fiesta, Focus, Fusion/Mondeo, Escape/Kuga, Edge, Ford Transit Connect, and Ford Transit, as
                            well as other models.</p>

                                <p style="font-size: 20px">The Mustang founded the pony-car phenomenon back in the 1960s with
                                trademarks that continue today: attractive styling, affordable performance, and ample
                                opportunities for personalization. The modern-day Stang is more sophisticated and powerful
                                (read: better) than ever. In fact, we named the GT and Bullitt versions to our 10Best Cars
                                list. In addition to a fantastic chassis, it has a standard 310-hp turbocharged
                                four-cylinder engine; a rip-roaring V-8 and 10-speed automatic transmission are optional.
                                High-performance add-ons include an active exhaust system, an adaptive suspension, and
                                Brembo brakes. Whether cruising the coast in a droptop model or roasting the rear tires in a
                                souped-up coupe, the Mustang has an expressive personality and exceptional performance</p>

                                    continues to improve its popular pony. The biggest news is the return of the legendary
                                    Bullitt model, which was inspired by the one Steve McQueen drove in the film of that same
                                    name. Along with its signature appearance, the V-8 coupe has more horsepower and extra
                                    performance equipment. Likewise, the limited-edition California Special package returns with
                                    styling that imitates the 1968 original. Enthusiasts will appreciate the new rev-matching
                                    feature on V-8 Mustangs with the manual transmission, and four-cylinder versions have an
                                    optional variable exhaust system. A new B&O PLAY audio system along with three new paint
                                    colors and over-the-top-stripes round out the changes for 2019.</p>
