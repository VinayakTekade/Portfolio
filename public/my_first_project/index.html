                        If prices in the mid-to-upper $100,000 range are too high, Mercedes-AMG would like you to meet the more "frugal" 4-Door Coupe. The GT 53 4-Door Coupe, that is.
                        The German luxury brand announced Thursday that the entry-level GT 53 model will cost $99,995, which includes a $995 destination fee. It's the cheapest way to 
                        step into Mercedes-AMG's first standalone sedan (well, hatchback, really) model, but it won't come with the beefy V-8. <br><br><br>
                        The just-barely sub-$100,000 price nets buyers a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 paired with Mercedes' EQ Boost system. In the case of the GT 53, it makes 21 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque. Total output is 429 hp and 384 lb-ft of torque, which is enough to send the hatchback sedan from 0-60 mph in about 4.4 seconds. Power is sent through a 9-speed automatic transmission to a standard all-wheel-drive system. The GT 53 will scream all the way to its electronically limited top speed of 174 mph.

                      The 2019 Aston Martin Vantage is a lovely looking thing, but not all potential buyers want a coupe. 
                      Never fret because the British company said it will debut a Vantage Roadster later this year.
                      The word comes from Aston Martin chief creative officer, Marek Reichman.
                      The executive said work on the Vantage Roadster is complete and the firm will lift the lid on the 
                      convertible later this year, according to a Thursday report on the Australian website Car Advice. 
                      He wouldn't say when, but the drop-top sports car could grace the Frankfurt motor show in September.<br><br><br>
                      The new Vantage ushered in a new look for the sports car in 2017. It's a familiar story under the hood, 
                      with a Mercedes-AMG-supplied twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 making 503 horsepower and 505 pound-feet of torque.
                       Specific tuning by the Brits ensures the engine retains a unique soundtrack. Power flows through an 8-speed 
                       automatic transmission to the rear wheels.

                    Lotus will grace the world with a new sports car in 2020, and the brand's CEO has spilled the first details about what we should expect from the as-yet unnamed car.
                    CEO Phil Popham, a former Jaguar-Land Rover and Sunseeker yacht executive, said the car will not usher in a new platform in an interview with told Autocar published Friday. 
                    The next Elise, Exige, and Evora have that honor. Instead, this sports car will ride on a heavily updated Lotus architecture that will focus on practicality and ergonomics. 
                    Most importantly, it will be the first new car from Lotus under Chinese owner Geely. A Toyota engine should also power the sports car as that partnership continues unchanged 
                    for now. Popham added it will drive like a Lotus and focus on lightweight materials.<br><br><br>
                    Geely's real influence on Lotus likely won't become clear until next decade when new models arrive on a new platform, and the CEO said the new sports car will be somewhat of
                    stepping stone. He said there's this new sports car, then everything else will arrive on a new architecture that is just now under development. Popham said to not expect new 
                    cars based on it for about three or four years after work on the platform has been completed. He provided no timeframe for the architecture, but he suggested it may not be 
                    bonded aluminum if engineers find a better option.
